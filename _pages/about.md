# About

Hi, I am an engineer and software developer from Germany with a strong focus on automation and control. My interests include smart manufacturing and sensor technologies, cyber-physical systems, and hardware-oriented programming.

I created this website to write down my thoughts and share my insights about technical related topics in a (hopefully) easy to understand language.

Any feedback is highly welcome.
